Snake the Game

Here are some basic instructions of the game's features and rules for the game
There's also a config file in the working folder. There's no need to make
changes directly to the config file since wrong config file causes malfunction
of the game

Basic rules:

- Snake can't eat itself / go through itself (includes tail to make it harder) => game will end
- Snake can only move inside the game area, hitting the area boundaries => end
- Game will also end when there's no space left in the area
- Snake can eat normal food (green) or superfood (glowing magenta<->blue). More about superfood in
settings and features section.

Snake / Game controllers:

- W: Up
- D: Right
- S: Down
- A: Left
- Space: pause the game, also with the button

OBS! If you're moving up (W), you can't put the snake instantly down (S) or vice
versa. Same applies with right and left too.

Logically, pause works only when the game is on

Score system:

- With greater speeds you can get more points by eating food
- Superfood can also adjust score, so you'll get more points for a few seconds
